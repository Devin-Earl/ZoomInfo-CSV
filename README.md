## Project title
ZoomInfo-CSV

## Motivation

What started as two good friends discussing the recent tech layoffs turned into an a Node JS script. 
After watching my recently furloughed tech recruiter friend mess with excel for hours to try and gather a list of prospective contacts at Series A startups before his ZoomInfo license gets cut turned into this idea. 

This script simply uses ZoomInfo's API to preform a search based off Company Name and Job Title and returns specific info based off whatever parms you need. 

COMING SOON: Python Script to scrape ZoomInfo for non Enterprise folks 

Write to CSV instead of JSON in console log like current.

## Tech/framework used

Python- Creating a second script to scrape ZoomInfo soon 


## Installation

## API Reference
