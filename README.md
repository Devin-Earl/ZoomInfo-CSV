## ZoomInfo-CSV

## Motivation
What started as two good friends discussing the recent tech layoffs turned into an a Node JS script. 
After watching my recently furloughed tech recruiter friend mess with excel for hours to try and gather a list of prospective contacts at Series A startups before his ZoomInfo license gets cut turned into this idea. 

## Tech/framework used
Javascript,
Python- Creating a second script to scrape ZoomInfo soon 


## Installation
npm install ZoomInfo-CSV

## API Reference

https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/


## How to use?
After downloading the NPM Package make sure to create an .Env you may need to modify the index.js to pull additional info from the Zoom Info Search API, you will also need to modify the write to csv function to account for new data recieved in response from the Zoom Info API after modifying the search query.
